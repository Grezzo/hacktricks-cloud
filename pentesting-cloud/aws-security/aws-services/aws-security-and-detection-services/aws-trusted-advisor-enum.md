## AWS Trusted Advisor Overview

Trusted Advisor is a service that **provides recommendations** to optimize your AWS account, aligning with **AWS best practices**. It's a service that operates across multiple regions. Trusted Advisor offers insights in four primary categories:

1. **Cost Optimization:** Suggests how to restructure resources to reduce expenses.
2. **Performance:** Identifies potential performance bottlenecks.
3. **Security:** Scans for vulnerabilities or weak security configurations.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Recommends practices to enhance service resilience and fault tolerance.

The comprehensive features of Trusted Advisor are exclusively accessible with **AWS business or enterprise support plans**. Without these plans, access is limited to **six core checks**, primarily focused on performance and security.

### Notifications and Data Refresh

* Trusted Advisor can issue alerts.
* Items can be excluded from its checks.
* Data is refreshed every 24 hours. However, a manual refresh is possible 5 minutes after the last refresh.

### **Checks Breakdown**

#### CategoriesCore

1. Cost Optimization
2. Security
3. Fault Tolerance
4. Performance
5. Service Limits
6. S3 Bucket Permissions

#### Core Checks

Limited to users without business or enterprise support plans:

1. Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted
2. IAM Use
3. MFA on Root Account
4. EBS Public Snapshots

A list of checks primarily focusing on identifying and rectifying security threats:

* Security group settings for high-risk ports
* Security group unrestricted access
* Open write/list access to S3 buckets
* MFA enabled on root account
* RDS security group permissiveness
* CloudTrail usage
* SPF records for Route 53 MX records
* HTTPS configuration on ELBs
* Security groups for ELBs
* Certificate checks for CloudFront
* IAM access key rotation (90 days)
* Exposure of access keys (e.g., on GitHub)
* Public visibility of EBS or RDS snapshots
* Weak or absent IAM password policies

AWS Trusted Advisor acts as a crucial tool in ensuring the optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerance of AWS services based on established best practices.
